    "# The Relationship Between Obesity and Internet Use\n",

    "Determination and interpretation of the relationship between the number of obese people received from 200 countries between 1975 and 2016 and the number of people using the internet. We expect the relationship between these two features to be a linearly increasing correlation. Because we think that using the internet and technology together reduces the need for people to move. In this project, we investigated the emergence of the lack of movement, the main cause of obesity, with the spread of the internet and technology."

The fact that the Internet brings distant things closer to us has made it easier for people not only in the field of health but also in many business areas. But, this not only facilitated the achievement of hard-to-achieve things, but also reduced the effort that people exerted to achieve them. \n",

    "   These are the privileges that come to our feet thanks to the internet, without any long or tiring effort. But we know that acting is inherent in nature, benefiting human health and prolonging life by reducing heart conditions. Obesity is one of the main diseases that have been on the agenda for the last 10 years and emerged as a result of inactivity. We think obesity is caused by immobility, poor quality meals and eating too much food. We know that the use of the Internet completely fills our free time with the principles of social media and remote work. So much so that sometimes we don't have enough time to eat or eat. So we order fast food 'online' to meet our food needs. Although these fast food foods look great, we get hungry again and want to eat again because they are of poor quality. Thus, we both eat a lot and eat high-carb meals on the effect of the internet on us. Organizing eating habits in this way may cause obesity. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   In the light of these thoughts, we tried to show the connection between countries by comparing the number of citizens who are obese with internet usage by years."
